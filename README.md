# Cryptocurrency Cabal - PS 1

University of Virginia, Fall 2015

Starting code for [Problem Set 1 - Bitcoin Transactions](http://bitcoin-class.org/ps/ps1/).

This code uses the [BTC Suite](https://github.com/btcsuite) library for
bitcoin.

- keypair.go: code for generating a bitcoin key pair (including its public address).
- spend.go: code for generating a bitcoin transaction.

This is intended for learning and exploration only!  

IT WOULD BE VERY FOOLISH TO SEND ANY SIGNIFICANT FUNDS TO ADDRESSES GENERATED OR USED IN
THIS CODE.

**Credits:** the original code was written by Nick Skelsey and Alex Kuck for the Spring 2015 cs4501: Cryptocurrency Cafe course, and updated for Fall 2015.
